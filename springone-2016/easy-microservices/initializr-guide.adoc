= SpringOne Platform 2016 : Easy Consumption of Microservices

== Anatomy of the Initializr

TBD

== Step 0: Initial Development Setup

Follow these steps to setup and configure your development environment to be able to customize the
Initializr web application:

* Fork and clone: https://github.com/spring-io/initializr.git [for the conference should this be my
repo?]

* Verify that you can actually build and run the project (this requires the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started-installing-spring-boot.html#getting-started-installing-the-cli[Spring Boot CLI])

....
% cd initializr-service
% spring run app.groovy
....

* Visit the running Initializr http://localhost:8080/[application].

* Once your sure its properly executing, quit out (ctrl-c) and then import the project into your
favorite IDE.  We will be using IntelliJ for this but any IDE will work.

IMPORTANT: When using the IDE for Initializr,  we've found it much easier to create a separate
module that represents a more traditional "main" class over using the CLI in initializr-service.
This will make it easier to take advantage of devtools and the debugger.

* Create a new Maven module 'initializr-app'
** Select the root "initializr" in Project view and right-click: New > Module
** Leave "Maven" selected and click Next
** Set artifactId :: initializr-app and click Next
** Set Module name :: initializr-app and click Finish

Now you have a sub module that will be your starting point for future customization (this makes it
much easier to run/debug/test in your IDE).

* Copy all the resources (yml/xml) from the initializr-service to initializr-app src/main/resources

NOTE: this has the implication that you will need to periodically sync changes from the upstream
project and add them to this copy of application.yml

* Add required dependencies to the initializr-app pom.xml:

```xml
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.spring.initializr</groupId>
      <artifactId>initializr-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.spring.initializr</groupId>
      <artifactId>initializr-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.spring.initializr</groupId>
      <artifactId>initializr-generator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```

. Create a new Spring Boot application class in src/main/java (under com.company.io.spring.initializr)

```java
package com.company.io.spring.initializr;

import java.util.concurrent.Executor;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.AsyncConfigurerSupport;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableAsync;
import org.springframework.scheduling.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor;

@SpringBootApplication
public class InitializrApp {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext ctx = SpringApplication.run(InitializrApp.class, args);
  }

  @Configuration
  @EnableAsync
  static class AsyncConfiguration extends AsyncConfigurerSupport {
    @Override
    public Executor getAsyncExecutor() {
      ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
      executor.setCorePoolSize(1);
      executor.setMaxPoolSize(5);
      executor.setThreadNamePrefix("initializr-");
      executor.initialize();
      return executor;
    }
  }
}
```

Verify these changes by executing the main from the IDE.  Right-click the InitializrApp Java file
and select > Debug 'InitializrApp'.  Again, visit http://localhost:8080 and review the running
application.

NOTE: You may have noticed that we included spring-boot-devtools in the dependencies.  This will
really help speed up local development along with the LiveReload plug-in.

If this is all working, make a change to the web template in initializr-web >
src/main/resources/templates/home.html - change "Spring Initializr" to "My Spring Initializr" and
select Build > Compile 'home.html' / command+shift+f9 (in IntelliJ).  Voila!

== Step 1: Let's add a 3rd party dependency

*Scenario*: You've discovered a great 3rd-party library you want all of your teams to start using
it.  You also want it to be available for selection from the Initializr.  In this example, we want
to use http://www.jasypt.org/[Jasypt] to encrypt properties in our properties files and we found the
perfect https://github.com/ulisesbocchio/jasypt-spring-boot[project] that does that for us:

. Modify the initializr-app :: src/main/resources/application.yml
.. Add a custom section (below Ops):

```yml
    - name: Custom
      content:
        - name: Jasypt
          id: jasypt
          description: Provides Jasypt encryption support for property sources
          version: 1.6
          groupId: com.github.ulisesbocchio
          artifactId: jasypt-spring-boot-starter
```

NOTE: Since Spring Boot is not managing this dependency we have to specify the exact version OR
provide our own BOM.

. Select "Make Project" and wait for the reload
.. In the Dependencies field, you can now type 'Jasypt' or 'encrypt' and the dependency will be automatically show up.
. Verify your changes by generating a new project with the Web, Acutator and Jasypt dependencies.
. Unzip the generated project and add the following encrypted properties to the src/main/resources/application.properties:

....
secret.property=ENC(nrmZtkF7T0kjG/VodDvBw93Ct8EgjCA+)
secret.password=ENC(nrmZtkF7T0kjG/VodDvBw93Ct8EgjCA+)
....

. Execute the application:

....
% ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=9000 -Djasypt.encryptor.password=password
....

. Visit the applications http://localhost:9000/env/[env] URL.
Notice how Spring Boot masks the value if the property name contains password.

== Step 2: Lets add a VCS .ignore file

*Scenario*: Most of us are using Git right?  For those of us that are, a common step after
generating a project is to add a .gitignore file and setup Git.  Let's just have the Initializr
automatically do part of that for us.

SIDE: Technically, there is already an open https://github.com/spring-io/initializr/issues/131[request]
for this on the Initializr.  This is just one possible implementation.

* Visit https://www.gitignore.io/
* Type in: Java, Gradle, Maven, Eclipse and IntelliJ and hit "Generate" (or just visit https://www.gitignore.io/api/java,gradle,maven,eclipse,intellij)
* Copy the page contents and create a file named "gitignore" in initializr-generator - src/main/resources/templates

....

Adding the template alone will not have an effect, we have to change the Groovy generator code.

* in initializr-generator, modify io.spring.initializr.ProjectGenerator > doGenerateProjectStructure (approx line 155):

```groovy
        write(new File(dir, '.gitignore'), 'gitignore', model)
```

WARNING: Normally, this should have been enough to get the file template to be included but there is
an unusual side effect of Ant's zipfileset that excludes certain files (like .gitignore). We have
to change this default behavior before it will work.

* In initializr-web, modify io.spring.initializr.web.project.MainController > springZip (approx line 217):

```groovy
        zipfileset(dir: dir, includes: '**', excludes: wrapperScript, defaultexcludes: "no")
```

* Select the "Make Project" and wait for the UI reload.

* Generate a new application and unzip it.  You should now be able to verify that a .gitingore file
is included with Spring Boot.

== Step 3: Lets add a customizable README

*Scenario*: Since we are generating a starter Spring Boot application it might be a good idea to
include a customizable README with links to documentation, etc.

* Create a README.adoc file in the initializr-generator > src/main/resources/templates

....
= Spring Boot README

TBD

Generated on <% out.print new Date() %>
....

* in initializr-generator, modify io.spring.initializr.ProjectGenerator > doGenerateProjectStructure (appox line 156):

```groovy
        write(new File(dir, 'README.adoc'), 'README.adoc', model)
```

* Verify by selecting the "Make Project" and wait for the UI reload.  Then generate an application
of any kind and unzip to see the README.adoc

But wait, there is more that can be done.  Since the Initializr is using Groovy templates, it is
possible to get full access to the metadata model inside of the README.  We can enhance it to
include more information about the original generation process and even provide conditional
documentation:

....
= Spring Boot README

== ${name}

* Group: ${groupId}
* Artifact: ${artifactId}
* Java Version: ${javaVersion}

${description}

== Dependencies

<% compileDependencies.each { %>* ${it.groupId}:${it.artifactId}${it.version ? ":$it.version" : ""}
<% } %>

<% if (compileDependencies.find { it -> it.artifactId == 'jasypt-spring-boot-starter' }) { %>
=== Jasypt
To add encrypted properties, please refer to the following https://github.com/ulisesbocchio/jasypt-spring-boot[documentation].
<% } %>

----
Generated on <% out.print new Date() %>
....

FYI: You might have to touch the ProjectGenerator.groovy file to be able to force a Make Project to
occur (sometimes just modifying the template isn't enough for IntelliJ to think something has
changed).

* Make Project and wait for the UI reload.  This time, generate an application with the Jasypt
dependency and see that it contains the extra documentation link.

== Step 4: Wait a minute!  You've not been writing any unit tests! (Lets write some tests)

....
% mvn clean package
....

Well, at least we haven't broken anything (yet).  However, testing of the Initializer can be HARD
and its actualy quite easy to break something.

* Add a test case to ProjectGeneratorTests.groovy (initializr-generator >
src/test/groovy/io/spring/initializr/generator)

```groovy
	@Test
	void customFilesWithDefaultProject() {
		def request = createProjectRequest('web')
		generateProject(request)
				.hasFile(".gitignore")
				.hasFile("README.adoc")
	}
```

* Run the JUnit tests and verify that you get a GREEN bar.  This verifies that both Step 2 and
Step 3 are actually generating a file as part of the project.

* Now lets add a test that verifies that the README.adoc actually contains the extra info when we
include Jasypt.  To do this well need to add an additional assetion to the built-in ProjectAssert that the tests are
already using.  This will make sure a specific value is found in the file passed in:

```groovy
	ProjectAssert assertFileContains(String localPath, String... expressions) {
		def candidate = file(localPath).text;
		for (String expression : expressions) {
			assertTrue "$expression has not been found in source file '$localPath'", candidate.contains(expression)
		}
		this
	}
```

We can now use this as part of a formal test in ProjectGeneratorTests.groovy (initializr-generator >
src/test/groovy/io/spring/initializr/generator):

```groovy
	@Test
	void readmeContainsExtraInfoWithJasyptDeps() {
		def dependency = new Dependency(id: 'jasypt', groupId: 'com.github.ulisesbocchio', artifactId: 'jasypt-spring-boot-starter', version: "1.6")
		dependency.facets << 'web'
		def metadata = InitializrMetadataTestBuilder.withDefaults()
				.addDependencyGroup('core', 'web', 'security', 'data-jpa')
				.addDependencyGroup('test', dependency).build()
		applyMetadata(metadata)

		def request = createProjectRequest('jasypt')

		generateProject(request)
				.hasFile("README.adoc")
				.assertFileContains("README.adoc", "=== Jasypt");
	}
```

NOTE: In the long run, it is arguably better to just create a brand new test case for your customized
behaviors - this should limit the merge conflicts that you have when the Initializr project matures
(and it will).  Remember what we're typically doing is higly customized behaviors that are unique to
our company or team.  These aren't likely to be adopted by the Initializr team, so we'll frequently
end up having to merge in changes from upstream.

== Step 5: Let's make it easier to generate a "standard" Microservice

*Scenario*: We want some standardization on the required starters for our team (for example, all
services need to use Actuator).  The default Initializr doesn't have any built-in support for groups
of dependencies, so lets add the ability to support this

* In initializr-web > src/main/resources/templates modify the home.html to include a selection
element for the various application archetypes we want to support:

```html
                    <!-- begin custom stuff -->
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="archetypes" class="control-label">Select a Starter Archetype</label>
                        <select id="archetypes">
                            <option value="NONE">Ad hoc</option>
                            <option value="REST">Microservice (REST)</option>
                            <option value="FOO">Foo</option>
                            <option value="BAR">Bar</option>
                        </select>
                    </div>
                    <!-- end custom stuff -->
```

This modifies the default Initializr UI to include a Select field just above the "Search for
dependencies" field.  Our goal is to auto select dependencies for a specific application archetype.

* Add an change listener to this element in the src/main/resources/static/js start.js file:

```javascript
    // begin custom changes
    $("#archetypes").on("change", function (e) {
        // this could be a little smarter...
        $("#starters div").remove();
        $("#dependencies input").prop('checked', false);
        var results = [];
        switch ($(this).find(":selected").val()) {
        case "REST":
            results = starters.get(['web','actuator','cloud-hystrix','security', 'jasypt', 'cloud-starter-sleuth', 'devtools']);
            break;
        case "FOO":
            results = starters.get(['thymeleaf', 'web', 'actuator', 'security', 'devtools']);
            break;
        case "BAR":
            results = starters.get(['batch']);
        }
        for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
            addTag(results[i].id, results[i].name);
            $("#dependencies input[value='" + results[i].id + "']").prop('checked', true);
        }
    });
    // end custom changes
```

* Click "Make Project" and verify that selecting the REST archetype now auto selects the predefined
starters.

Combined with being able to add our own custom dependencies we now have a solid base for quickly
generating Boot apps that are more in line with our team's guidelines and standards.  We can ensure
our teammates will be setup for success right out of the gate.

== Step 6: Let's enhance our Git support

*Scenario*: We already created a .gitignore file to support our VCS but what we'd really like is to
have the repo automatically created with the initial commit.  In fact, why not just go all the way
and push this first commit directly to GitHub?

* In the initializr-generator lets add a dependency to JGit to the pom.xml (approx line 31):

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.eclipse.jgit</groupId>
			<artifactId>org.eclipse.jgit</artifactId>
			<version>4.4.0.201606070830-r</version>
		</dependency>
```

* Refresh the Maven dependencies.  This library will make it possible to initialize git and perform
a automated push, but first, lets make this an option that a user can select.  Add a checkbox to
the initializr-web form in src/main/resources/templates/home.html (approx line 38):

```html
                    <h3> Initialize Git Repo?
                        <input type="checkbox" id="initGit" name="initGit" tabindex="2">
                    </h3>
```

With a simple checkbox we can now toggle the decision to initialize a git repository
as part of the Generate.  To fully support this, we need to add the attribute to
the underlying model.

* Add a Boolean property to BasicProjectRequest.groovy in initializr-generator >
src/main/groovy/io/spring/initializr/generator (approx line 42):

```groovy
	Boolean initGit
```

Just adding this attribute now makes it available in the ProjectGenerator.

* Wrap the original gitignore write logic with a check and call out to a new
method to do the actual git init:

```groovy
if (request.initGit == true) {
  write(new File(dir, '.gitignore'), 'gitignore', model)
  gitSetup(dir, request)
}
```

And then add the new getSetup function:

```groovy
void gitSetup(File dir, ProjectRequest request) {
  Git git;
  try {
    // use ~/.github/conf.properties
    Properties props = new Properties()
    File propFile = new File(System.properties['user.home'], ".github/conf.properties")
    propFile.withInputStream{ props.load(it) }

    // git init, add and commit
    git = Git.init().setDirectory(dir).call();
    git.add().addFilepattern(".").call();
    git.commit().setAll(true).setMessage("Initial commit by Initializr").call();

    // git remote and branch config
    StoredConfig config = git.getRepository().getConfig();
    config.setString(CONFIG_REMOTE_SECTION, "origin", "url", "${props.url}/${request.name}.git");
    config.setString(CONFIG_BRANCH_SECTION, "master", "remote", "origin");
    config.setString(CONFIG_BRANCH_SECTION, "master", "merge", "refs/heads/master");
    config.save();

    // now push it
    git.push().setCredentialsProvider(new UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider(props.username, props.password)).call();
  } catch (Exception ex) {
    publishProjectFailedEvent(request, ex)
    throw ex
  } finally {
    git?.close();
  }
}
```

NOTE: We found a slight issue with the build wrapper scripts and the git setup
related to the fact that the zipfileset process is marking them as executable
(after the git commit).  This causes git to see set the files as being modified
when you unzip the repo.  Our workaround is to modify the writeTextResource
process and add a call to setExecutable(true).

* In ProjectGenerator.groovy (approx line 321)

```groovy
writeTextResource(dir, 'gradlew', 'gradle/gradlew').setExecutable(true)
```

And (appox line 324):

```groovy
writeTextResource(dir, 'mvnw', 'maven/mvnw').setExecutable(true)
```

Now the files will be committed with 755.  Note, this approach might not work on
Windows systems.  If you unzip the generated project and do a git status and see
something not up to date, this is likely the cause.

Before we can actually test these changes, we need to perform a couple of manual
steps on GitHub.

* Go to your personal GitHub account and create an empty repo called
"demo-mytest"

* In your personal home folder, create a folder/file ~/.github/conf.properties

```
url=https://github.com/<your-github-name>
username=<your-oath-token>
password=
```

See https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/
for more info on GitHub OAuth tokens.

* Restart the Initializr app and generate a Boot application with the Artifact
name "demo-mytest".  Make sure you select the Initialize Git Repo? [X] option.

WARNING: If you see errors about authentication it is likely your OAuth token
isn't valid or is not be read properly by the initGit function (use your
debugger to verify this).  You may also get a NoRemoteRepository exception.  In
this case, it is likely the Artifact name does not match the empty repository
name in GitHub.

By now, you should be able to see where this is all going.  We're very close to
having a completely automated repo provisioned directly from the Initializr.

== Step 7: Use the GitHub API to finalize automation

*Scenario*: We want to fully automate the work from Step 6.  Since GitHub
requires an empty repo to be created before it can be pushed, we'll have to
explore options as to how to do this from code.

* Add the http://github-api.kohsuke.org/[GitHub API] dependency to the
initializr-generator project pom.xml (right under the jgit dependency):

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.kohsuke</groupId>
      <artifactId>github-api</artifactId>
      <version>1.76</version>
    </dependency>
```

* Refresh the IntelliJ dependency and add the logic to the gitSetup function in
ProjectGenerator.groovy (approx line 183):

```groovy
    // initialize the remote repo
    GitHub gitHub = GitHub.connect();
    gitHub.createRepository(request.name)
          .description(request.description)
          .create();
```

We had to make a minor refactor to the .github/conf.properties file.  The
"GitHub API for Java" uses a .github file in the user home folder.  All I needed
to do was remove the folder and recreate a text file called .github with the
conf.properties and an additional oauth property

```
url=<your github home>
username=<your oauth token>
password=
oauth=<your oauth token>
```

And update the properties loader in the ProjectGenerator (approx line 180):

```groovy
			File propFile = new File(System.properties['user.home'], ".github")
```

SIDE: We should probably just go back to Step 6 and refactor that step to setup
the .github configuration file as needed by this step (it was just lucky how
close we actually were).

* Restart the app and wait for the UI to refresh.

Assuming the changes take effect, you should now be able to generate from the
Initializr and have it automatically create the GitHub repo for you.  This was
actually pretty easy.

== Step 8:
